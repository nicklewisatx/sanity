# Discovery Questions

Based on my analysis of the codebase:
- The UI package already has Storybook configured with component stories
- The web app already imports some components from @workspace/ui
- Both are using React 19.1.0 and compatible versions

## Q1: Will you want to view and interact with Storybook components directly within the apps/web application?
**Default if unknown:** No (Storybook typically runs as a separate development tool on port 6006)

## Q2: Do you need to create new pages in apps/web that showcase UI components (like a pattern library)?
**Default if unknown:** No (apps/web is for end-user content, not component documentation)

## Q3: Are there specific Storybook components that are missing from apps/web that you need to use?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (likely want to use more of the available components)

## Q4: Should the integration maintain the current import pattern from @workspace/ui?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistency with existing codebase patterns is important)

## Q5: Will you need to sync component props/variants between Storybook stories and web app usage?
**Default if unknown:** No (stories are for documentation, actual usage may differ)
