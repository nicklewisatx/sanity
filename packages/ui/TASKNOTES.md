## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

- [x] Simplified Implementation Plan to 3 phases
- [x] Updated Component Checklist to be more practical
- [x] Enhanced Resources section with helpful links

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Storybook already configured with necessary addons (a11y, themes)
- [x] Created comprehensive stories for all existing components:
  - [x] accordion.stories.tsx - Multiple variants, FAQ example, long content
