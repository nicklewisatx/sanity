# Sanity + Next.js Project Guide

This is a modern monorepo project using Next.js 15, Sanity Studio v3, and TurboRepo.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

- Web app: http://localhost:3000
- Sanity Studio: http://localhost:3333

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                    # Start all apps in background mode
pnpm watch                  # Start all apps with live console output (formerly pnpm dev)
pnpm dev:bg                # Start all apps in background (same as pnpm dev)
pnpm dev --filter=web      # Start specific app

# Process Management
pnpm kill                  # Kill processes on ports 3000-3004 & 3333
pnpm stop                  # Same as kill - stops all dev processes
pnpm status               # Show running app processes
pnpm restart              # Kill and restart development

# Code Quality
pnpm lint                  # Run linter
pnpm format               # Format code
pnpm check-types          # Type checking

# Sanity
cd apps/studio && pnpm run type     # Generate types
cd apps/studio && npx sanity deploy # Deploy studio
```

## Process Management

The project includes scripts for managing development processes:

- **`pnpm dev`** - Starts development servers in background mode (shows initial output then exits)
- **`pnpm watch`** - Starts development servers with live console output (use for debugging)
- **`pnpm kill` / `pnpm stop`** - Gracefully terminates all processes running on ports 3000-3004 and 3333
- **`pnpm status`** - Shows the status of tracked development processes
- **`pnpm restart`** - Stops all processes and restarts development servers

When running `pnpm dev`, the processes will start up, show initial output, then continue running in the background after the command exits. Use `pnpm status` to check if servers are running and `pnpm stop` or `pnpm kill` to stop them.

**Important**: Avoid using `pnpm watch` for normal development as it keeps the terminal occupied. Use `pnpm dev` instead to run servers in the background.

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` files:

```bash
# apps/web/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=your-token

# apps/studio/.env.local
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Edit files, hot reload works automatically
2. **Check Types**: Run `pnpm check-types` before committing
3. **Format Code**: Run `pnpm format` to ensure consistency
4. **Generate Types**: After schema changes, run type generation
